    "In mid 2017, maize prices in Kenya shot through the roof. Being a staple food in most part of the country, this shortage  caused a grave crisis. Apparently the crisis was caused by lack of rainfall in major maize producing regions like Eldoret and this led to large scale hoarding by the traders. A 90kg bag of maize which caused ksh.3000 was now KSh 6,750, the highest in the country's history. The crisis caused political tension in the country with the oppostion party accusing the governmnet of failing to plan for poor harvests. The government resorted to importation of maize from Mexico. \n",
